    <title>Foreword</title>
    <paragraph>
      The idea of organizing this meeting originated from a personal experience,
      while I attended the conference in Alpbach, Tirol, called "Other Realities" in September 1983.
      There, a series of speakers, most of them unknown to me at that time, like Bohm, Varela, Sheldrake,
      Steindl-Rast, Berman, Thompson, Baiker-Roshi, and even the Dalai-Lama, were comparing notes
      in front of a mixed audience about the convergence of science, religion, and philosophy under
      the general framework of "New Age."
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      This expression loosely meant that new values, new "paradigms," were appearing in the awareness
      of intellectual communities, and that we were perhaps at a turning point, witnessing the outcome
      of a new conceptual framework for interpreting the wholeness of life, including science.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      This notion has as a corollary that the traditional figure of the specialized scientist, which our
      universities produce and nourish, is no longer fit to cope with the multidimensional set of problems
      of the world we live in.
